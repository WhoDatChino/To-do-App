#To-do App

This is my first attempt at a solo project to hone my skills and dive in the deep end.

This is a To-do list app where the user is able to easily create new lists and tasks through a simple user interface design. I am no UI designer, but I tried my best - my knowledge of colour theory and whitespace utilisation and so on could use some more workðŸ˜…. I took inspiration from UI/UX implementations as seen on Google where they try minimise the number of clicks for a user to achieve the goals they want as well as offering some customisation options without overwhelming the user with unlimited choices.
